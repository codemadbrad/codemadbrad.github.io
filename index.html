<h2>But first, a few things about me...</h2>

<body>I was born at an early age in the thriving metropolis of Columbus Ohio to parents and just 10 minutes after my twin sister came into the world.  My mother was never supposed to have children, and yet, the Lord decided to bestow upon my parents not just one child, but a set of twins.  And then, 6 years later, our family was blessed by a new baby girl.
I grew up in Columbus Ohio, and am proud to be a Buckeye.  However, I did not attend college at The Ohio State University.  No, I attended a small, Christian Liberal Arts college by the name of Huntington College (now Huntington University).  HU is located in a small town just west of Fort Wayne Indiana.  After college, I moved back to Columbus, held a hand full of jobs, and eventually followed my friends Rich and Jenny Wug / Robles to Chicago, where they had lived for several years.  I moved to Chicago and began to attend Evanston Vinyard Fellowship church.  I had plans to visit several other churches in the area, but just could not bring myself to leave the Vineyard.  I met the one who would eventually become the love of my life, Kathleen, at the Vineyard, and we have had lots of fun adventures in our 10 years of marriage.  The most recent adventure is parenting our now 1-year old son, Bennett.  He is such a joy and a blessing, and we are so happy to have him in our lives.
