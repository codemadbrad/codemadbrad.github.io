      <li>Spiderco pocket knife - I love this little knife!  I prefer the 60/40 split between the straight edge and the serrated edge on the knife blade for the sake of additional durability and utility.</li>

      <li>Victorinox Swiss Army Knives.  My preference is the Victorinox brand over Wenger, but I do think the Wenger is a quality product as well.  I carry this particular knife with me on my keyring.  It has a ball-point pen, a small red flash light, and a cross-head screw driver which easily fits the screws that hold computer cases in tact.  It will also fit the mounting hardward for many computer components - quite handy when harvesting parts out of older equipment.</li>
